A smart solution for beehive monitoring using Arduino boards!

--------

"Beehive Control" is a student project for "Smart Enviroments and Applications" course of department of Informatics - Ionian University, made by [Pashalis Grivas](https://github.com/p17griv), [George Gerarchakis](https://github.com/p17gera) and [George Melidoniotis](https://github.com/p17meli). The main goal of this project is to design and implement a smart solution of a real-world problem. More specifically, we recommend a set of Arduino boards and other hardware components ("Beehive Control Arduino Kit") and we provide a simple implementation of user applications (Web & Android App), in order for beekeepers to monitor their beehives remotely.
